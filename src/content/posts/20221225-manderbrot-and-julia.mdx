**Note**: This post requires you to have a basic understanding of complex numbers.
If you don't know what complex numbers are, you can read about them [here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/complex-numbers.html).

## Introduction

I love conding, and I also have a passion for mathematics.
I've always wanted to combine my love of coding and my knowledge of mathematics
to create interesting but also educational visualization, something similars to the works of
 [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) and [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@thecodingtrain).

I've always been fascinated by fractals. The Mandelbrot and Julia sets are
two of the most famous fractals, and the formuation also easy to understand. They are great entry points
for people who want to code their own fractal visualizations. However, there are some challenges
when rendering fractals in real time, and I'll be explaining how to overcome along the coding process.

For the visualization tool, I decide to choose [PIXI.js](https://www.pixijs.com/), a 2D rendering engine
for the web that supports WebGL. It's very easy to use, and also very fast. Along that, I'll be using its React wrapper
called [react-pixi](https://reactpixi.org/) to make the work more easier.

## What is Mandelbrot set?

The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers that are bounded under the iteration of the function:

$$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$$

where $z_0 = 0$ and $c$ is a complex number.
