I'm passionate about web developement, especially the frontend tools.
I spent a lot of time doing some experiement with some of the most popular frontend UI frameworks.
Among of those, my favorite cloices are so far React and Svelte.

After playing with code, I decided to make a portfolio website to advertise myself to potential employers.
Now, I have to **pick only one** of two my favourite framework.
I like React because of its powerful community with many third-party packages,
but and I also love the fun and simplicity of Svelte.
It was a tough decision. What if I can use both of them in the same application? Luckily, I found **Astro**.

## Why Astro?

[Astro](https://astro.build) is a perfect candiate for my portfolio project,
and here some reasons:

- It is a _static site generator_ (SSG), suitable for building portfolio
  since I may not update the content very often
- It allows to ship a website with _no or little JavaScript_,
  which means websites building with Astro is blazingly fast
- It is compatible with many existing UI frameworks like React or Svelte
- It has a lot of itergration tools, where you can quickly install with Astro CLI

## Other tools

Alongside with Astro, I also use other tools to aid my DX and make tthe website more beautiful.

### Tailwind

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) is a ultility-first CSS framework where you can quickly style
the component with predefined class names.
Normally, I found styling components is a slow and painful experience.
However, Tailwind is easy to learn and can quickly speed up the developement process.
Tailwind also provides more benefits such as

- **Unopinionated**: Tailwind can work with any exisiting UI platforms. I can style the document
  everywhere in plain HTML, React, or Svelte.
- **Great documentation**: navigation around the [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) is easy
- **Smooth DX**: Tailwind also provide VSCode extension called Tailwind CSS Intellisense
- **Integration with Astro** with [`@astrojs/tailwind`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/)

### MDX

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is the extension of markdown file, allows us to use JSX elements in mardown.
MDX also integrate with Astro via [`@astrojs/mdx`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)

Markdown is great format to quickly compose a blog post, but sometimes I want to
include some interactivity within the blog post, like my favourite website Brillant.
The JSX supports for MDX allows me to add visulization for better explaning the concepts
and make the post more unique and compelling.

### Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a deployment platform for frontend developers.

Recently, I migrated all my web projects to Vercel, and love how easy it is to deploy my apps.
Whenever I push the code the main branch, Vercel will automatically deploy my apps with the [Github integration tool](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/vercel-for-github).
This helps me focus more building the app while Vercel is taking care the complexity of deployment pipeline.
