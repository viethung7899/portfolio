## Introduction

A few year ago, I implemented a sudoku solver using Python. 
However, the solver only works in the CLI mode and only supports one simple algorithm, backtracking.
Website is the best tool to visualizing yourr idea, so my goal today is to make a soduku solver
and animating the solving process with different algorithms. Like any visualization I did before, 
it will be embedded in this blog post.

Also, I want to attempt to use the Algorithm X and Dancing Link by Donald Knuth to solve the Sodoku. 
I have read the paper and the book, but I have never implemented it. So this is a good chance to
do it.
