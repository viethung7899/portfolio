## Introduction

Sudoku, the popular logic-based puzzle, has challenged puzzle enthusiasts for years.
The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, 
each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. 
In this blog post, we will explore an intriguing method called the 
Wave Function Collapse algorithm and its application to solving Sudoku puzzles.

## Wave Function Collapse

The Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm is a computational technique initially developed for procedural generation tasks. 
However, it has found interesting applications in solving various *constraint satisfaction* problems, including Sudoku puzzles. 
The algorithm's essence lies in **propagating information** about the possible states of each cell based on the constraints of the puzzle.

### The Algorithm

The WFC algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm that operates on a grid of cells.
Each cell has a set of possible states, and the algorithm attempts to find a valid assignment of states to the cells.
The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Find the cell with the fewest possible states.
2. For each possible state of the cell, assign the state to the cell and propagate the information to the neighboring cells.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the grid is filled or a contradiction is found.
4. If a contradiction is found, backtrack to the previous state and try a different state for the cell.

The **propagation step** is the most important part of the algorithm.
It is where the algorithm propagates information about the possible states of each cell to the neighboring cells.
The propagation step is also where the algorithm can detect contradictions in the grid.
