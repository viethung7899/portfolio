import SortingVisualizer from "../interactives/SortingVisualizer.svelte";


## Motivation

Sorting problem are classic introductory topic for any first-year computer science.
The algorithms are little bit intimidated at the first place, but they introduce a veriey
of interesting concepts to guide students to think like programmers for better problem solving.

My goal here is to create a tool to visualize sorting algorithms.
I hope a clear visualization can aid student to understand these algorithms. There are a lot of
website for visualizing algorithms. In fact, I already made a website for that purpose. Most of them
are just standalone websites. However, my challenge is to integrate the visulization within the blog post.

## Interactive integrations

As mention on the [previous blog](/blogs/how-i-built-my-portfolio-with-astro), I use the MDX format compose the blog posts.
MDX allow us to inject the JSX elements inside the markdown files, which means I can add some interactive
elements for the users to play around within the blog post. 
For the implementation, React components is the best option to embed interactivity within the blog post.

## What can you do with the sorting visualizer?

The visualizer support these features below

- Change the number of elements in the array
- Change the sorting algorithms
  - Bubble sort
  - Selection sort
- Change the speed of animation
- Supported algorithms (more to update)
