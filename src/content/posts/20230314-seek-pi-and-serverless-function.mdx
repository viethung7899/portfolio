title: Seeking digits of Ï€ with serverless function

Happy $\pi$ day everybody! I'm going to show you how to use serverless functions to build an API for find digits in $$\pi$$.
It may not the most useful use case for the serverless functions, but it's a fun one. 
More importantly, you can see the API in action with an embedded $\pi$ finder in my blog below. 
Just type in any sequences in the form to find their positions among the first **one million** digits in $\pi$.

import SeekPi from "@interactives/pi/SeekPi.svelte"

<SeekPi />

## Why serveless function?

Some of you may think why don't let the client side do the calculation. 
Well, it could be a good idea, but it only applies for the small case like 1000 or 10000 digits.
