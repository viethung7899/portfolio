## Prelude

As you can see from my frontpage, I'm passionate about web developement, escapacially the frontend tools.
I spent a lot of time doing some experiement with some of the most popular UI tools. 
Among of those, my favorite cloices are so far React and Svelte.

After playing with code, I decided to make a portfolio website to advertise myself to potential employers. 
Now, I have to pick one of two my favourite framework to build a simple multi-page application for my website. 
React has NextJS and Svelte has SvelteKit. It was a tough choice.

What if I can use both React and Svelte in the same application? Luckily, I found Astro.
