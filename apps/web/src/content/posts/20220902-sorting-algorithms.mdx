## Motivation

Sorting problem are classic introductory topic for any first-year computer science.
The algorithms are little bit intimidated at the first place, but they introduce a veriey
of interesting concepts to guide students to think like programmers for better problem solving.

My goal here is to create a tool to visualize sorting algorithms.
I hope a clear visualization can aid student to understand these algorithms. There are a lot of
website for visualizing algorithms. In fact, I already made a website for that purpose. Most of them
are just standalone websites. However, my challenge is to integrate the visulization within the blog post.

As mention on the [previous blog](/blogs/how-i-built-my-portfolio-with-astro),
I use the MDX format compose the blog posts.
MDX allow us to inject the JSX elements inside the markdown files.
For the implementation, I choose Svelte to embed interactivity within the blog post
because its simplicity.

## Features

The [visualizer](#sorting-visualizer) supports these features below

- Set the number of elements in the array (from 10 to 100 elements)
- Choose your algorithms
  - Bubble sort
  - Selection sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Merge sort
  - Quicksort
  - Heap sort
- Change the sorting speed (even when the animation is running)
- Play, pause and resume the animation

## Implementation

### Render with Svelte components

First, we create a type to represent the state of each item in the array.
Each item has a `value` and a `status` to indicate the state of the item
when the algorithm is running.

```ts title="types.ts"
export type Item = {
  value: number;
  status: "none" | "selected" | "sorted" | "pivot";
}
```


Now, we can a Svelte component represent each item in the array.
As you can see, I use simple div elements to represent the items, where the height of the div
is determined by the `value` property of the item. Meanwhile, the `status` property is used to determine
the rendering style of the item.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import type { Item } from "./types";

  export let item: Item;
</script>

<div
  class="flex-1 rounded-sm"
  style:height={`${item.value}%`}
  class:none={item.status === "none"}
  class:selected={item.status === "selected"}
  class:sorted={item.status === "sorted"}
  class:pivot={item.status === "pivot"}
/>

{/* More styling below */}
```

### Generator functions

Generartor functions are functions that can **stop midway** and **resume** to where it stopped.
They can be defined with the `function*{:js}` keyword.

Let's take a look a example below


```js showLineNumbers title="generator.js" {3,5}
function* foo() {
  console.log("To the foo land...");
  yield "Hello";
  console.log("Welcome back...")
  yield "World";
  console.log("Bye bye!");
}

const fooGen = foo();
console.log(fooGen.next()) // Exit at line 3
console.log(fooGen.next()) // Exit at line 5
console.log(fooGen.next()) // Exit at line 6
```


And here's the output

```json
To the foo land...
{ done: false, value: "Hello" }
Welcome back...
{ done: false, value: "World" }
Bye bye!
{ done: true, value: undefined }
```


When calling a generator function, it does not execute immediately, 
but rather return a special **Generator** object. 
The object has a method called `next(){:ts}`, which starts the execution of
the function until reaching the `yield{:ts}` statements, then returns an object with two proprties: 
- `done{:ts}`: a boolean to indicate the whether the function finish its execution
- a `value{:ts}` specified after the stopping `yield{:ts}` statement

Because of generator functions can pause during their execution, 
they can be a perfect tool to visualize sorting algorithms since we need the state
of the array during the sorting procedure.

### Lazy sorting functions

First, let take a look at very simple bubble sort function

Suppose we have a simple bubble sort implementation in TypeScript

```ts showLineNumbers title="bubbleSort.ts"
export function bubbleSort(items: Item[]) {
  const n = items.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    let swapped = false;
    for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
      // Compare and swap
      if (items[j].value > items[j + 1].value) {
        const temp = items[j];
        items[j] = items[j + 1];
        items[j + 1] = temp;
        swapped = true;
      }
    }
    if (!swapped) break;
  }
}
```

To better show the algorithm execution, we need to pause the algorithm when it picks items, swaps, unpicks items, or indicate a sorted item.
We can do that by directly change the state of the diresed item and 
place the `yeild` statement after the change to capture the state of the sorting array.

```ts showLineNumbers title="bubbleSort.ts" {9-11, 18, 23-24, 27-30}
import type { Item } from "./types";

export function* bubbleSort(items: Item[]) {
  const n = items.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    let swapped = false;
    for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
      // Pick elements
      items[j].status = "selected";
      items[j + 1].status = "selected";
      yield items;

      // Compare and swap
      if (items[j].value > items[j + 1].value) {
        const temp = items[j];
        items[j] = items[j + 1];
        items[j + 1] = temp;
        yield items;
        swapped = true;
      }

      // Unpick elements
      items[j].status = "none";
      items[j + 1].status = "none";
    }
    if (!swapped) break;
    else {
      items[n - i - 1].status = "sorted"
      yield items;
    }
  }
  items.forEach(item => item.status = "sorted");
  yield items;
}
```

### Animating algorithm

Now, we can use the generator function to animate the sorting algorithm.
We can use the `next(){:ts}` method of the generator function to get the next state of the array.
Here's the implementation for the `play(){:ts}` function

```ts {8}
const play = async () => {
    playing = true;
    while (playing) {
      state = generator.next();
      if (state.done) {
        playing = false;
      } else {
        items = state.value;
        await sleep();
      }
    }
  };
```

The magic of Svelte is that it will automatically update the DOM when the any dependent value is reassigned, as highlighted above.
So, we can simply use `items{:ts}` to render the array.

```svelte
{#each items as item}
  <SortingItem item={item} />
{/each}
```
